# Code Challenge 08: Linked List - merge two linked list
Merge two singly linked lists. â€‹

 ## Challenge
The challenge is to implement a function called merge lists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two
linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a
reference to the head of the zipped list.
