Implement a selection sort function

# Selection Sort
**Worst Case Performance: O(N^2)
**Average Performance: O(N^2)
Insertion sort is a simple, inefficient algorithm. Basically, it says:

# Selection Algorithm
1. Iterate through the whole array and set the first index as the smallest value.
1. Iterate through the unsorted list starting at index 1 
1. Compare if the value is greater than the current index
1. Assign the value if the element is smaller than the current index
1. After iteration swap the minimum value and
1. Repeat finding the smallest value over and over for each index of the array.
1. This sorting algorithm is a classic example of something that runs in O(N^2) time.
1. It uses two nested for loops. The first for loop iterates through each index of the array,
